      <p>Hello! I'm Jamie, a passionate front-end developer with 2 years of experience. Last year, I made the decision to dedicate myself to this field by enrolling in a front-end development bootcamp through Promineo Tech. The bootcamp was an incredible experience that significantly boosted my skills and knowledge. Since completing the bootcamp, I have been actively working on various projects and studying on different coding platforms so I can apply what I learned in new projects, with a strong focus on JavaScript. My goal is to become a master in this area, continuously learning and improving. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I am dedicated to continuously growing in my skills as both a developer and problem solver. Let's create something remarkable together!</p>
